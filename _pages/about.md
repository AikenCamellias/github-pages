# About the Aiken Camellia Society

The Aiken Camellia Society is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to promoting the appreciation, cultivation, and preservation of camellias in the Aiken, South Carolina area and beyond.

## Our Mission

- **Education**: Provide resources and knowledge about camellia cultivation, care, and varieties
- **Community**: Bring together camellia enthusiasts to share experiences and expertise
- **Preservation**: Support the conservation of historic and rare camellia varieties
- **Promotion**: Increase public awareness and appreciation of camellias through shows and events

## History

The Aiken Camellia Society is proud to maintain a Local Speakers Bureau to expand the love and knowledge of camellias throughout the surrounding area. We conduct speaking engagements annually to garden and civic organizations locally in South Carolina and Georgia.

The Aiken Camellia Society held it's 65th annual camellia show in January of 2017, and an educational show in nearby North Augusta, SC has spawned considerable interest and a re-awakening of North Augusta’s camellia heritage.

A few short miles away in adjacent Edgefield, South Carolina, the camellia enthusiasts have sponsored a very successful Camellia Tea during the blooming season. This was the first camellia activity since the popular teas held there in the 1950’s.

We are proud of our camellia heritage and have increasing excitement for spreading the appreciation and knowledge of camellias throughout our area.
